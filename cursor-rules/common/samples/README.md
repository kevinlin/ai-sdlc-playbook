# Rule Samples

This directory contains sample implementations of Cursor rules for different programming languages and frameworks.

## Available Samples

- **[general_python.mdc](./general_python.mdc)**: Sample implementation of general rules for Python projects
- **[general_vue.mdc](./general_vue.mdc)**: Sample implementation of general rules for Vue.js projects

## Purpose

These sample files demonstrate how to adapt the general rules to specific programming languages and frameworks. They serve as practical examples to help you implement and customize Cursor rules for your own projects.

## Usage

1. Review the sample implementation that most closely matches your project's technology stack
2. Use it as a reference when creating your own rule files
3. Modify and combine rules as needed to suit your specific requirements

## Contributing

If you have sample implementations for other programming languages or frameworks, feel free to contribute them by submitting a pull request.
