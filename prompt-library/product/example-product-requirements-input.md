I'm writing a governance checklist app for Defra governance project tracking. Here are the features of the app:

- This tool allows projects to track their governance process through a unified checklist, composed of multiple governance workflows, each with their own checklist items.
- There can be multiple governance workflows of checklist items, such as a main governance flow, then sub-flows depending on what part of the business you're delivering for.
- The checklist items are general, but should be able to support these types - labels are examples: 'approval' (where the checklist item requires somebody to upload a document as evidence of the approval and state the person, date/time of the approval when checking off), 'document' (where the user must upload the latest version of the document before checking off). I guess 'approval' items also have 'document' item aspects to it, so it's likely they are just two additional types of a normal checklist item (without any states), 'event' could be another type.
- A checklist item should have states (example labels): 'incomplete', 'complete', 'not required'. 
  
...and so on...
