My knowledge of <topic> is incomplete. Please produce a **single-pass output**: 
- start with a **BLUF** (Bottom Line Up Front), 
- then provide an **assumptions table** (including defaults), 
- up to **5 key clarifications** (if I don’t respond, proceed on the <default track>), 
- **2–3 solution options with a trade-off matrix**, 
- expert-level deep dive, 
- **A–E quality gates**, 
- the **minimum ready-to-implement deliverables** (plan/checklist/template/script snippets, etc.), 
- **testing/evaluation and monitoring**, 
- **risks and consequences**, 
- and **3 next steps** that can be done within 48 hours. 

Style should be pragmatic, bullet-pointed, and avoid unnecessary wording. 

If external verification is allowed, mark key conclusions as **Verified** / **Pending verification**.
