# Frontend Integration Tests

```
Create tests for [feature].

## Analysis Requirements
1. Review jest testing cursor rules 
2. Study existing tests for patterns and conventions in [file]
3. Analyze:
   - Source code architecture
   - Integration points
   - External dependencies requiring mocks
   - Data models and flows
   - Existing test coverage

## Implementation Guidelines
1. Test Structure:
   - Focus on end-to-end workflows over isolated units
   - Mock external dependencies appropriately

2. Test Coverage:
   - Core user scenarios and workflows
   - Edge cases and error conditions
   - Both happy and unhappy paths

3. Quality Standards:
   - Clear test descriptions
   - Meaningful assertions

## Constraints
- Scope: Modify only the test file and test utilities / helpers
- Format: Deliver complete, production-ready test code
- Standards: Follow jest testing cursor rules

## Output
Provide the complete test implementation in a single code block, following all project conventions and testing standards.
