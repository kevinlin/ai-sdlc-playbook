# Glossary

This glossary defines key terms used throughout the AI SDLC Playbook to ensure consistent terminology and understanding.

## A

**AI IDE** - An Integrated Development Environment enhanced with artificial intelligence capabilities, such as Cursor or GitHub Copilot-enabled editors. These tools provide AI-powered code generation, completion, and assistance.

**AI Tools** - Software applications that leverage artificial intelligence to assist in development tasks, including code generation, testing, documentation, and analysis.

## F

**Functional Requirements** - Specifications that define what a system should do from a user's perspective, focusing on expected behaviors, user interface elements, and testable features. Always used in plural form throughout this playbook.

## I

**IDE Rules** - Configuration files that guide AI behavior in development environments. These rules provide system-level guidance to AI assistants and define coding standards, patterns, and conventions.

## M

**MCP (Model Context Protocol)** - A protocol that enables AI models to connect with external data sources and tools, extending their capabilities beyond their training data.

**MCP Server** - A backend service that implements the Model Context Protocol, providing AI models with access to specific tools, APIs, or data sources.

**Memory Bank** - A structured documentation system that helps AI assistants maintain project context across sessions through organized Markdown files.

## P

**Prompt Engineering** - The practice of crafting effective prompts to guide AI models toward desired outputs, including techniques like meta-prompting and iterative refinement.

**Project Rules** - AI IDE rules that are specific to a project, stored in version control and scoped to the codebase.

## T

**Technical Specification** - A detailed document that defines how functional requirements will be implemented technically, including data models, API endpoints, backend architecture, and implementation details.

## U

**User Rules** - AI IDE rules that are global to a user's environment and applied across all projects, typically used for personal preferences and coding style.

## Terminology Standards

To maintain consistency throughout the documentation:

- Use "Functional Requirements" (plural) when referring to the concept or collection of requirements
- Use "AI IDE" consistently instead of mixing "AI-powered IDE" and "AI IDE"
- Use "AI tools" as the general term for AI-assisted development software
- Use "Technical Specification" (singular) when referring to the document type
- Use American English spelling throughout (e.g., "analyze" not "analyse", "optimize" not "optimise")
