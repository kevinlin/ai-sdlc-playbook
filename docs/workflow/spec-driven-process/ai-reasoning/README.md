## Quick Navigation
- **Foundation:** [Methodology](../README.md) - Understand the spec process first
- **Apply Learning:** [Prompting Strategies](../prompting/README.md) - Use insights for better AI collaboration
- **See in Action:** [Case Studies](../examples/case-studies.md) - Real examples of AI reasoning
- **Design Context:** [Design Phase](../process/design-phase.md) - Where reasoning is most critical

Insights into the decision-making frameworks and thought processes used during spec development.

## In This Section

- **[Decision Frameworks](decision-frameworks.md)** - How choices are evaluated and prioritized
- **[Examples](examples.md)** - Real decision points with detailed explanations

## Understanding AI Decision-Making

This section provides transparency into how AI systems approach spec development, including:

- **Requirement Analysis** - How user needs are interpreted and structured
- **Design Evaluation** - Criteria used to assess technical approaches
- **Task Sequencing** - Logic behind implementation order and dependencies
- **Trade-off Assessment** - How competing priorities are balanced

## Why This Matters

Understanding the reasoning process helps you:
- Provide better input and feedback during spec development
- Anticipate potential issues or alternative approaches
- Learn systematic thinking patterns for your own planning
- Collaborate more effectively with AI systems
