Step-by-step walkthrough of the three-phase spec-driven development workflow.

## In This Section

- **[Requirements Phase](requirements-phase.md)** - Gathering and structuring requirements using EARS format
- **[Design Phase](design-phase.md)** - Creating comprehensive design documents with research
- **[Tasks Phase](tasks-phase.md)** - Breaking down design into actionable coding tasks
- **[Change Management](change-management.md)** - Managing spec evolution and handling discovered requirements
- **[Workflow Diagrams](workflow-diagrams.md)** - Visual process flows and decision points

## The Three-Phase Workflow

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
  [*] --> Requirements : Start with user needs
  Requirements --> Design : Requirements approved
  Design --> Tasks : Design approved
  Tasks --> [*] : Ready for implementation
  
  Requirements --> Requirements : Iterate based on feedback
  Design --> Design : Refine design
  Tasks --> Tasks : Adjust task breakdown
```

Each phase builds upon the previous one, with explicit approval gates to ensure quality and alignment before proceeding.

## Phase Overview

1. **Requirements** - Transform rough ideas into structured, testable requirements
2. **Design** - Research and architect a comprehensive solution
3. **Tasks** - Create an actionable implementation plan with discrete coding steps
