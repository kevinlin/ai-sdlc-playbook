## Overview

The Tasks Phase is the final phase of the spec-driven development process, transforming the approved design into a structured implementation plan consisting of discrete, actionable coding tasks. This phase serves as the bridge between planning and execution, breaking down complex system designs into manageable steps that can be executed incrementally by development teams or AI coding agents.

As the third phase in the Requirements ‚Üí Design ‚Üí Tasks workflow, the tasks phase ensures that all the careful planning and design work translates into systematic, trackable implementation progress.

## Purpose and Goals

The tasks phase serves to:
- Convert design components into specific coding activities
- Sequence tasks for optimal development flow and early validation
- Create clear, actionable prompts for implementation
- Establish dependencies and build order between tasks
- Enable incremental progress with testable milestones
- Provide a roadmap for systematic feature development

## Step-by-Step Process

### Step 1: Design Analysis and Task Identification

**Objective**: Break down the design into implementable components

**Process**:
1. **Review Design Components**: Identify all system components that need to be built
2. **Map to Code Artifacts**: Determine what files, classes, and functions need to be created
3. **Identify Dependencies**: Understand what needs to be built before other components
4. **Consider Testing Requirements**: Plan for test creation alongside implementation
5. **Sequence for Early Validation**: Order tasks to validate core functionality quickly

**Task Identification Guidelines**:
- Focus on concrete coding activities (writing, modifying, testing code)
- Each task should produce working, testable code
- Tasks should build incrementally on previous work
- Avoid tasks that can't be completed by a coding agent

### Step 2: Task Structuring and Hierarchy

**Task Organization Principles**:
1. **Two-Level Maximum**: Use only top-level tasks and sub-tasks (avoid deep nesting)
2. **Logical Grouping**: Group related tasks under meaningful categories
3. **Sequential Dependencies**: Order tasks so each builds on previous work
4. **Testable Increments**: Each task should result in testable functionality

**Task Hierarchy Pattern**:
```markdown
- [ ] 1. [Epic/Major Component]
- [ ] 1.1 [Specific implementation task]
  - [Task details and requirements references]
- [ ] 1.2 [Next specific task]
  - [Task details and requirements references]

- [ ] 2. [Next Epic/Major Component]
- [ ] 2.1 [Specific implementation task]
  - [Task details and requirements references]
```

### Step 3: Task Definition and Specification

**Task Specification Elements**:
1. **Clear Objective**: What specific code needs to be written or modified
2. **Implementation Details**: Specific files, components, or functions to create
3. **Requirements Traceability**: Reference to specific requirements being implemented
4. **Acceptance Criteria**: How to know the task is complete
5. **Testing Expectations**: What tests should be written or updated

**Task Description Template**:
```markdown
- [ ] X.Y [Task Title]
  - [Specific implementation objective]
  - [Files or components to create/modify]
  - [Key functionality to implement]
  - _Requirements: [Requirement references]_
```

### Step 4: Dependency Management and Sequencing

**Dependency Considerations**:
1. **Foundation First**: Core interfaces and data models before dependent components
2. **Bottom-Up Approach**: Lower-level utilities before higher-level features
3. **Test-Driven Sequence**: Tests alongside or before implementation
4. **Integration Points**: Plan for connecting components as they're built

**Sequencing Strategies**:
- **Core-First**: Build essential functionality before optional features
- **Risk-First**: Tackle uncertain or complex tasks early
- **Value-First**: Implement high-value features that can be tested quickly
- **Dependency-Driven**: Respect technical dependencies between components

### Step 5: Task Validation and Refinement

**Task Quality Criteria**:
1. **Actionable**: Can be executed by a coding agent without additional clarification
2. **Specific**: Clear about what files, functions, or components to create
3. **Testable**: Results in code that can be tested and validated
4. **Incremental**: Builds on previous tasks without big complexity jumps
5. **Complete**: Covers all aspects of the design that require implementation

**Validation Questions**:
- Can a developer start coding immediately from this task description?
- Does this task produce working, testable code?
- Are the requirements being implemented clearly identified?
- Does this task build logically on previous tasks?
- Is the scope appropriate (not too big, not too small)?

## Task Categories and Patterns

**Sequence**:
```markdown
1. Core user registration (end-to-end)
2. User authentication (end-to-end)
3. User profile management (end-to-end)
4. Advanced features and optimizations
```

**Advantages**:
- Early user value delivery
- Faster feedback cycles
- Reduced integration risk

**Disadvantages**:

- Potential for technical debt

### Strategy 3: Risk-First Approach
**Best for**: Projects with high technical uncertainty, proof-of-concepts
**Sequence**:
```markdown
1. Most uncertain/complex components
2. External integrations and dependencies
3. Core business logic
4. User interface and experience
5. Polish and optimization
```

2. High-risk/high-value feature slice
3. Expand foundation as needed
4. Additional feature slices
5. Integration and polish
```

**Advantages**:
- Balances risk management with early value
- Flexible and adaptable
- Pragmatic approach

## Advanced Dependency Management Strategies

### Dependency Types and Management

#### 1. Technical Dependencies
**Definition**: Code components that must exist before others can be built

**Examples**:
- Database models before services that use them
- Authentication middleware before protected endpoints
- Configuration setup before feature implementation

**Management Strategy**:
```markdown
- [ ] 1. Core infrastructure setup
- [ ] 1.1 Create database connection and configuration
- [ ] 1.2 Set up authentication middleware framework
- [ ] 1.3 Create base error handling utilities

- [ ] 2. Foundation models (depends on 1.1)
- [ ] 2.1 Create User model with database integration
- [ ] 2.2 Create Session model with database integration

- [ ] 3. Authentication services (depends on 1.2, 2.1, 2.2)
- [ ] 3.1 Implement login service using User and Session models
```

#### 2. Logical Dependencies
**Definition**: Features that build conceptually on others

**Examples**:
- User profile editing requires user registration
- Password reset requires user authentication
- Advanced search requires basic search

**Management Strategy**:
```markdown
- [ ] 1. Basic user management
- [ ] 1.1 User registration functionality
- [ ] 1.2 User login functionality

- [ ] 2. Extended user features (depends on 1.1, 1.2)
- [ ] 2.1 User profile editing (requires existing users)
- [ ] 2.2 Password reset (requires authentication system)
```

#### 3. Data Dependencies
**Definition**: Tasks that require specific data or state to exist

**Examples**:
- User dashboard requires user data
- Reporting features require transaction data
- Admin features require user roles

**Management Strategy**:
```markdown
- [ ] 1. Data foundation
- [ ] 1.1 Create user registration and sample data
- [ ] 1.2 Create transaction recording system

- [ ] 2. Data-dependent features (depends on 1.1, 1.2)
- [ ] 2.1 User dashboard (requires user data from 1.1)
- [ ] 2.2 Transaction reporting (requires transaction data from 1.2)
```

### Dependency Visualization Techniques

#### Simple Dependency Chain
```
Task A ‚Üí Task B ‚Üí Task C ‚Üí Task D
```

#### Parallel Dependencies
```
Task A ‚Üí Task C
Task B ‚Üí Task C
```

#### Complex Dependency Graph
```
Task A ‚Üí Task C ‚Üí Task E
Task B ‚Üí Task D ‚Üí Task E
Task A ‚Üí Task D
```

### Handling Circular Dependencies

**Problem**: When tasks seem to depend on each other
```
User Service needs Auth Service
Auth Service needs User Service
```

**Solutions**:

1. **Interface Extraction**:
```markdown
- [ ] 1.1 Create IUserService and IAuthService interfaces
- [ ] 1.2 Implement UserService using IAuthService interface
- [ ] 1.3 Implement AuthService using IUserService interface
- [ ] 1.4 Wire up dependency injection
```

2. **Layered Approach**:
```markdown
- [ ] 1.1 Create User data model and basic CRUD
- [ ] 1.2 Create Auth service using User CRUD
- [ ] 1.3 Enhance User service with Auth integration
```

3. **Event-Driven Decoupling**:
```markdown
- [ ] 1.1 Create event system for user/auth communication
- [ ] 1.2 Implement User service with event publishing
- [ ] 1.3 Implement Auth service with event listening
```

## Task Writing Best Practices

### Writing Effective Task Descriptions

**Good Task Example**:
```markdown
- [ ] 2.1 Create User model with validation
  - Implement User class with email, password, name, and createdAt fields
  - Add validation methods for email format (RFC 5322) and password strength (8+ chars, mixed case, numbers)
  - Create unit tests covering valid/invalid email formats and password requirements
  - _Requirements: 1.2, 2.1_
```

**Poor Task Example**:
```markdown
- [ ] 2.1 Build user stuff
  - Make user things work
  - Add some validation
  - _Requirements: 1.2_
```

### Task Scope Guidelines

**Appropriate Task Scope**:
- Can be completed in 1-4 hours of focused work
- Produces working, testable code
- Has clear completion criteria
- Builds incrementally on previous tasks

**Too Large**:
```markdown
- [ ] 1.1 Implement complete user management system
```

**Too Small**:
```markdown
- [ ] 1.1 Add semicolon to line 42
```

**Just Right**:
```markdown
- [ ] 1.1 Create User model with validation methods
```

### Requirements Traceability

**Always Include**:
- Reference to specific requirements being implemented
- Clear connection between task and user value
- Traceability for testing and validation

**Example**:
```markdown
- [ ] 3.2 Implement password reset functionality
  - Create password reset request endpoint
  - Add email sending for reset tokens
  - Implement secure token validation
  - _Requirements: 1.3, 4.2_
```

## Common Task Planning Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: Tasks Too Abstract
**Problem**: "Implement user management"
**Solution**: "Create User model with email validation and password hashing"

### Pitfall 2: Missing Dependencies
**Problem**: Tasks that can't be completed because prerequisites aren't built
**Solution**: Sequence tasks so each builds on completed work

### Pitfall 3: Non-Coding Tasks
**Problem**: "Deploy to production", "Get user feedback"
**Solution**: Focus only on coding, testing, and implementation activities

### Pitfall 4: Monolithic Tasks
**Problem**: Tasks that try to implement entire features at once
**Solution**: Break down into smaller, incremental steps

### Pitfall 5: Missing Test Tasks
**Problem**: Only implementation tasks without corresponding tests
**Solution**: Include test creation as part of each implementation task

## Quality Checklist

Before finalizing the task list, verify:

**Completeness**:
- [ ] All design components are covered by implementation tasks
- [ ] All requirements are addressed by one or more tasks
- [ ] Testing tasks are included for all major functionality
- [ ] Integration tasks connect all components

**Clarity**:
- [ ] Each task has a clear, specific objective
- [ ] Task descriptions specify what files/components to create
- [ ] Requirements references are included for each task
- [ ] Completion criteria are implicit or explicit

**Sequencing**:
- [ ] Tasks are ordered to respect dependencies
- [ ] Early tasks establish foundation for later work
- [ ] Core functionality is implemented before optional features
- [ ] Integration tasks come after component implementation

**Feasibility**:
- [ ] Each task is appropriately scoped for implementation
- [ ] Tasks can be completed by a coding agent
- [ ] No tasks require external dependencies or manual processes
- [ ] Task complexity increases gradually

## Troubleshooting Task Planning Issues

### Issue: Tasks Are Too Vague
**Symptoms**: Developers can't start coding from task descriptions
**Solution**: Add more specific implementation details and file/component names

### Issue: Task Dependencies Are Unclear
**Symptoms**: Tasks can't be completed because prerequisites are missing
**Solution**: Review task sequence and add missing foundation tasks

### Issue: Tasks Don't Map to Requirements
**Symptoms**: Difficulty tracing tasks back to user value
**Solution**: Add requirement references and validate coverage

### Issue: Task List Is Overwhelming
**Symptoms**: Too many tasks, unclear priorities
**Solution**: Group related tasks and focus on core functionality first

## Task Execution Guidance

### Preparing for Implementation

Before beginning task execution, ensure you have:

**Context Preparation**:
- [ ] Requirements document accessible and understood
- [ ] Design document reviewed and internalized
- [ ] Development environment set up and tested
- [ ] Testing framework configured and ready
- [ ] Version control system initialized

**Task Selection Strategy**:
1. **Start with Foundation Tasks**: Always begin with setup and core interface tasks
2. **Follow Dependencies**: Don't skip ahead to tasks that depend on incomplete work
3. **One Task at a Time**: Focus completely on a single task before moving to the next
4. **Validate Before Proceeding**: Ensure each task is fully complete and tested

### Step-by-Step Task Execution Process

#### Phase 1: Task Analysis
**Before starting any task**:
1. **Read Task Details Thoroughly**: Understand exactly what needs to be implemented
2. **Review Requirements References**: Understand the user value being delivered
3. **Check Dependencies**: Ensure all prerequisite tasks are complete
4. **Plan Implementation Approach**: Decide on specific technical approach
5. **Identify Success Criteria**: Know how you'll validate completion

#### Phase 2: Implementation
**During task execution**:
1. **Update Task Status**: Mark task as "in progress" before starting
2. **Create Tests First** (when applicable): Write failing tests that define success
3. **Implement Incrementally**: Build functionality step by step
4. **Test Continuously**: Validate each piece as you build it
5. **Document as You Go**: Add comments and documentation inline

#### Phase 3: Validation and Completion
**Before marking task complete**:
1. **Run All Tests**: Ensure new and existing tests pass
2. **Review Against Requirements**: Verify the task delivers required functionality
3. **Check Integration**: Ensure new code works with existing components
4. **Code Quality Review**: Check for maintainability and best practices
5. **Update Task Status**: Mark as complete only when fully validated

I need to implement task [X.Y] from the spec. Here's the context:

Requirements: [Reference specific requirements]
Design Context: [Key design decisions that affect this task]
Task Details: [Copy task description and details]
Dependencies: [What previous tasks this builds on]

Please implement this task following the specified approach and include appropriate tests.
```

**Iterative Development Approach**:
1. **Start Simple**: Implement basic functionality first
2. **Add Complexity Gradually**: Build up features incrementally
3. **Test Each Addition**: Validate every change before proceeding
4. **Refactor When Needed**: Improve code quality as you go

#### Managing Task Dependencies

**Dependency Validation Checklist**:
- [ ] All prerequisite tasks are marked complete
- [ ] Required interfaces and types are available
- [ ] Necessary configuration is in place
- [ ] Test infrastructure is ready

**Handling Blocked Tasks**:
1. **Identify Missing Dependencies**: What specifically is blocking progress?
2. **Check Task Sequence**: Are tasks ordered correctly?
3. **Create Missing Foundation**: Implement minimal prerequisites if needed
4. **Update Task Plan**: Adjust sequence if dependencies were missed

### Quality Assurance During Execution

#### Testing Strategy for Each Task

**Unit Testing**:
- Write tests for individual functions and methods
- Test both happy path and error conditions
- Aim for high code coverage on new functionality
- Use descriptive test names that explain behavior

**Integration Testing**:
- Test how new components work with existing code
- Validate data flow between components
- Test error handling across component boundaries
- Verify configuration and setup work correctly

**Validation Testing**:
- Test against original requirements
- Verify user-facing functionality works as expected
- Test edge cases and boundary conditions
- Validate performance meets expectations

#### Code Quality Standards

**During Implementation**:
- Follow consistent coding style and conventions
- Add meaningful comments for complex logic
- Use descriptive variable and function names
- Keep functions focused and single-purpose
- Handle errors appropriately

**Before Task Completion**:
- Remove debugging code and console logs
- Ensure proper error handling is in place
- Verify no security vulnerabilities introduced
- Check for performance implications
- Validate accessibility requirements met

### Troubleshooting Common Execution Issues

#### Issue: Task Requirements Are Unclear
**Symptoms**: Can't determine what exactly to implement
**Solutions**:
- Review the original requirements document for context
- Check the design document for implementation guidance
- Look at related tasks for patterns and consistency
- Break down the task into smaller, clearer sub-steps

#### Issue: Dependencies Are Missing
**Symptoms**: Can't complete task due to missing prerequisites
**Solutions**:
- Review previous tasks to ensure they're truly complete
- Identify minimal implementation needed to unblock progress
- Consider if task sequence needs adjustment
- Implement temporary stubs if necessary

#### Issue: Tests Are Failing
**Symptoms**: New or existing tests break during implementation
**Solutions**:
- Understand why tests are failing before fixing them
- Ensure new functionality doesn't break existing behavior
- Update tests if requirements have legitimately changed
- Add new tests to cover edge cases discovered

#### Issue: Task Scope Creep
**Symptoms**: Implementation becomes much larger than expected
**Solutions**:
- Review original task scope and stick to it
- Identify what can be deferred to later tasks
- Break large tasks into smaller, manageable pieces
- Focus on minimum viable implementation first

### Progress Tracking and Communication

#### Task Status Management

**Status Definitions**:
- **Not Started**: Task hasn't been begun
- **In Progress**: Actively working on implementation
- **Blocked**: Cannot proceed due to dependencies or issues
- **Review**: Implementation complete, awaiting validation
- **Complete**: Fully implemented, tested, and validated

**Status Update Guidelines**:
- Update status when beginning work on a task
- Add comments when tasks are blocked or delayed
- Mark complete only when all acceptance criteria are met
- Include brief notes about implementation decisions

#### Documentation During Execution

**Implementation Notes**:
- Record key technical decisions made during implementation
- Document any deviations from original task plan
- Note any issues encountered and how they were resolved
- Update design documentation if implementation reveals gaps

**Knowledge Transfer**:
- Write clear commit messages explaining changes
- Add inline documentation for complex logic
- Update README files with new setup or usage instructions
- Create examples or demos for new functionality

### Adapting the Process

#### Customizing for Different Project Types

**Small Projects**:
- Combine related tasks for efficiency
- Focus on essential functionality first
- Use simpler testing strategies
- Prioritize working software over extensive documentation

**Large Projects**:
- Maintain strict task boundaries
- Implement comprehensive testing at each step
- Focus on maintainability and extensibility
- Document architectural decisions thoroughly

**Team Projects**:
- Coordinate task assignments to avoid conflicts
- Establish code review processes
- Use consistent coding standards across team
- Communicate progress and blockers regularly

#### Handling Implementation Challenges

**When Tasks Take Longer Than Expected**:
1. Assess if scope has grown beyond original intent
2. Identify if additional sub-tasks are needed
3. Consider if task should be split into smaller pieces
4. Update estimates for remaining tasks based on learnings

**When Requirements Change During Implementation**:
1. Stop current work and assess impact
2. Update requirements and design documents first
3. Revise affected tasks in the implementation plan
4. Communicate changes to stakeholders
5. Resume implementation with updated context

**When Technical Blockers Arise**:
1. Document the specific technical challenge
2. Research potential solutions and alternatives
3. Consider if design needs to be adjusted
4. Implement minimal viable solution to maintain progress
5. Plan for optimization in later tasks if needed

## Integration with Spec-Driven Development Workflow

### Connection to Previous Phases

**From Requirements Phase**:
- Each task should trace back to specific requirements
- User value should be clear for every implementation task
- Acceptance criteria inform task completion validation

**From Design Phase**:
- Task structure follows architectural decisions
- Implementation approach aligns with design patterns
- Component boundaries respect design interfaces

### Feedback to Earlier Phases

**When Implementation Reveals Issues**:
- Update design document if architecture needs adjustment
- Clarify requirements if user needs are misunderstood
- Revise task plan if dependencies were missed

**Continuous Improvement**:
- Document lessons learned during implementation
- Update task planning process based on execution experience
- Refine estimation accuracy for future projects

## Next Steps

Once tasks are complete and approved:
1. **Begin Implementation**: Start executing tasks in sequence using the guidance above
2. **Track Progress**: Update task status as work is completed
3. **Maintain Quality**: Follow testing and validation practices throughout
4. **Stay Flexible**: Adjust tasks if implementation reveals issues
5. **Validate Against Requirements**: Ensure completed tasks satisfy original requirements
6. **Document Learnings**: Capture insights for future spec-driven development

The tasks phase provides the roadmap for systematic implementation, breaking down complex designs into manageable, actionable steps that lead to successful feature delivery. With proper execution guidance, teams can maintain quality and momentum throughout the implementation process.
