# Spec-Driven Development

A systematic approach to software development that emphasizes thorough planning, clear documentation, and structured implementation. Transform rough feature ideas into well-defined, implementable solutions through a process that ensures quality, maintainability, and successful delivery.

## Getting Started

**New to spec-driven development?** Start with the [complete guide](guide.md) to learn the methodology from idea to implementation.

**Already familiar?** Jump to specific sections:

- **[Examples](examples.md)** - See real specs and case studies
- **[Resources](resources.md)** - Templates, tools, and references

## Quick Overview

Spec-driven development follows a three-phase approach:

1. **Requirements** - Transform vague ideas into clear, testable requirements
2. **Design** - Create comprehensive technical plans for implementation  
3. **Tasks** - Break down designs into actionable, sequential implementation steps

Each phase builds upon the previous one, creating a solid foundation for successful feature development.

## When to Use

**✅ Recommended for:**
- Features with multiple components or integrations
- High-stakes projects where failure is costly
- Team collaboration and knowledge preservation
- Complex business logic or unfamiliar technology

**⚡ Use lightweight approach for:**
- Medium complexity, well-understood features
- Time constraints requiring faster delivery
- Small teams with good communication

**❌ Skip for:**
- Simple bug fixes or minor tweaks
- Experimental prototypes
- Time-critical hotfixes

## Benefits

- **Reduced Risk** - Identify issues early when they're cheaper to fix
- **Better Quality** - Thoughtful design leads to more robust implementations
- **Enhanced Collaboration** - Clear communication among team members and stakeholders
- **AI-Optimized** - Provides structured context that AI tools need to be most effective
