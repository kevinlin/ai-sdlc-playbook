## In This Section

- **[Strategies](strategies.md)** - Core approaches for clear, effective prompting
- **[Templates](templates.md)** - Ready-to-use prompt patterns for each phase
- **[Best Practices](best-practices.md)** - Tips for getting better results

## Key Principles

Effective prompting for spec development follows these principles:

1. **Be Specific** - Provide clear context and concrete examples
2. **Structure Requests** - Break complex asks into manageable parts
3. **Iterate Thoughtfully** - Build on previous responses rather than starting over
4. **Validate Understanding** - Confirm alignment before proceeding to next phases

## Common Patterns

- **Context Setting** - Establishing project background and constraints
- **Phase Transitions** - Moving smoothly between requirements, design, and tasks
- **Feedback Integration** - Incorporating changes and refinements effectively
- **Quality Validation** - Ensuring outputs meet your standards
