## Design Patterns Reference

### Common Patterns to Consider

**Creational Patterns**:
- Factory: When you need to create objects without specifying exact classes
- Builder: When constructing complex objects step by step
- Singleton: When you need exactly one instance of a class

**Structural Patterns**:
- Adapter: When integrating incompatible interfaces
- Decorator: When adding behavior without altering structure
- Facade: When simplifying complex subsystem interfaces

**Behavioral Patterns**:
- Observer: When objects need to be notified of state changes
- Strategy: When you need to switch between algorithms
- Command: When you need to parameterize objects with operations

**Architectural Patterns**:
- MVC/MVP/MVVM: For separating presentation from business logic
- Repository: For abstracting data access logic
- Unit of Work: For maintaining consistency across multiple operations
