## Task Planning Guidelines

### Task Structure Best Practices

#### Task Naming
- Use action verbs (Implement, Create, Add, Build)
- Be specific about what's being built
- Include the component or feature name
- Keep titles concise but descriptive

#### Task Details
- **Scope**: Clearly define what's included/excluded
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Specific, testable outcomes
- **Dependencies**: Prerequisites and blockers
- **Estimates**: Time or complexity estimates

#### Sub-task Organization
- Break large tasks into smaller, manageable pieces
- Each sub-task should be completable in 1-2 days
- Maintain logical sequence and dependencies
- Ensure each sub-task has clear deliverables

### Requirements Traceability

Each task should reference specific requirements:
- Use requirement numbers or identifiers
- Link to acceptance criteria being addressed
- Ensure all requirements are covered by tasks
- Validate task completion against requirements

### Testing Integration

Every implementation task should include testing:
- **Unit Tests**: For individual components and functions
- **Integration Tests**: For component interactions
- **End-to-End Tests**: For complete user scenarios
- **Performance Tests**: For non-functional requirements

### Complexity Factors
- **Technical Complexity**: New technologies, complex algorithms
- **Integration Complexity**: Multiple system interactions
- **Business Complexity**: Complex rules, edge cases
- **Testing Complexity**: Extensive test scenarios

### Risk Assessment
- **High Risk**: New technologies, external dependencies
