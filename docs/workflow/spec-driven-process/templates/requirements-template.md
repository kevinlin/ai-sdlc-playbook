## Requirements Review Checklist

Use this checklist to validate your requirements document:

### Completeness
- [ ] All user stories have clear roles, features, and benefits
- [ ] Each requirement has specific acceptance criteria using EARS format
- [ ] Non-functional requirements are addressed
- [ ] Success criteria are defined and measurable

### Quality
- [ ] Requirements are written in active voice
- [ ] Each acceptance criterion is testable
- [ ] Requirements avoid implementation details
- [ ] Terminology is consistent throughout

### EARS Format Validation
- [ ] WHEN statements describe specific events or triggers
- [ ] IF statements describe clear conditions or states
- [ ] WHILE statements describe continuous behaviors
- [ ] WHERE statements describe specific contexts
- [ ] All statements use SHALL for system responses

### Clarity
- [ ] Requirements are unambiguous
- [ ] Technical jargon is explained in glossary
- [ ] Stakeholders can understand all requirements
- [ ] No conflicting requirements exist

### Traceability
- [ ] Requirements are numbered and organized
- [ ] Dependencies between requirements are clear
- [ ] Requirements link to business objectives
- [ ] Assumptions and constraints are documented

## Tips for Writing Good Requirements

### Do's
- ‚úÖ Use active voice and specific language
- ‚úÖ Focus on what the system should do, not how
- ‚úÖ Make each requirement testable and verifiable
- ‚úÖ Include both positive and negative scenarios
- ‚úÖ Consider edge cases and error conditions

### Don'ts
- ‚ùå Don't use vague terms like "user-friendly" or "fast"
- ‚ùå Don't combine multiple requirements in one statement
- ‚ùå Don't specify implementation details
- ‚ùå Don't use subjective or unmeasurable criteria
- ‚ùå Don't forget to consider non-functional aspects

### Common EARS Patterns

**Event-Driven (WHEN)**
- User actions: "WHEN user clicks submit button"
- System events: "WHEN data sync completes"
- Time-based: "WHEN daily backup runs"

**Condition-Based (IF)**
- State checks: "IF user is authenticated"
- Data validation: "IF input is invalid"
- Permission checks: "IF user has admin role"

**Continuous (WHILE)**
- Ongoing processes: "WHILE file is uploading"
- Monitoring: "WHILE system is running"
- Real-time updates: "WHILE user is typing"

**Contextual (WHERE)**
- Platform-specific: "WHERE application runs on mobile"
- Environment-specific: "WHERE system is in production"
- Location-specific: "WHERE user is in restricted area"
