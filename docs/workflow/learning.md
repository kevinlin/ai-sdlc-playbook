# Learning with AI

## Overview

Although not strictly a workflow, learning new skills can be accelerated with AI.

AI can accelerate coding and learning, but there's a risk it might weaken developers' understanding of core software principles. To mitigate this risk, we have designed a learning prompt that helps developers write code efficiently whilst deepening their understanding of essential software practices.

This approach is particularly effective for:

- Learning new programming languages and technologies
- Maintaining existing services
- Understanding complex codebases

We advise adding the prompt below into the "User Rules" in Cursor. This ensures the IDE will incorporate these learning rules into every new prompt.

## Why this Prompt Works

- **Explains Core Concepts:** Provides detailed explanations of software design patterns and engineering principles used in code generation
- **Faster Learning:** Delivers real-time feedback and explanations to accelerate understanding
- **Diverse Solutions:** Presents multiple approaches to problem-solving
- **Active Engagement:** Promotes critical thinking about code design choices
- **Testing Knowledge:** Validates understanding through targeted questions about implemented code changes

The prompt can be found here: [Enhanced Teaching Guidelines](../prompt-library/general/prompt-enhanced-teaching-guideline.md)
