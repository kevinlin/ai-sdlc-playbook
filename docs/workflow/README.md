# AI Development Workflow Overview

This section outlines workflows for integrating AI into the development lifecycle. We provide three complementary approaches: a comprehensive formal workflow for enterprise projects, a spec-driven development process for systematic requirements management, and a Vibe Coding Plus workflow for rapid prototyping and smaller projects.

By following these workflows, teams can efficiently integrate AI into their development processes, ensuring high-quality results, maintainable code, and streamlined operations. All workflows emphasize iteration, validation, and continuous learning to maximize AI's potential in the SDLC.

## Workflow Options

### Formal Process Workflow
For enterprise projects, complex systems, and team-based development requiring thorough documentation and process adherence. This workflow follows a traditional structured approach with detailed phases.

### Spec-driven Development Process
A systematic approach to development that emphasizes thorough specification and requirements management before implementation. This process ensures alignment between stakeholders and development teams through detailed upfront planning.

### Vibe Coding Plus Workflow  
For rapid prototyping, small projects, and situations where speed and flexibility are prioritized over comprehensive documentation.

## Formal Process Workflow Steps

1. **[Getting Started](01-getting-started.md)** - A conceptual overview of getting started with AI development workflows.
2. **[Project Setup](02-project-setup.md)** - Define the foundational elements for the project, ensuring all necessary files, tools, and conventions are in place.
3. **Feature Development Lifecycle**

    1. [Functional Requirements](formal-process/01-functional-requirement.md) - Define expected behavior, UI, testable features, and user experience using AI tools to draft and refine.
    2. [Technical Specification](formal-process/02-technical-specification.md) - Define technical implementation, data models, API endpoints, and backend architecture.
    3. [Development](formal-process/03-development.md) - Develop the solution iteratively, leveraging AI for implementation.
    4. [Testing](formal-process/04-testing.md) - Unit, Functional and End to End testing
    5. [Refactoring](formal-process/05-refactoring.md) - Refactor once feature complete.
    6. [Documentation](formal-process/06-documentation.md) - Update all relevant documentation to reflect changes, ensuring clarity and alignment with project goals. Documentation is then used to feedback to the AI tools for future iterations.

## Spec-driven Development Process

*[Coming Soon]* - A structured approach that emphasizes comprehensive specification and requirements analysis before development begins. This process focuses on:

- Detailed requirements gathering and stakeholder alignment
- Comprehensive technical specification development  
- Systematic validation and approval workflows
- Specification-driven implementation and testing
- Continuous alignment verification throughout development

This process is ideal for:

- Complex systems requiring extensive stakeholder coordination
- Projects with strict compliance or regulatory requirements
- Teams prioritizing thorough upfront planning and specification
- Environments where requirements changes are costly
- Projects requiring detailed technical architecture documentation

## Additional Workflows
