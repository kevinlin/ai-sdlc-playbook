# AI Development Workflow Overview

This section outlines workflows for integrating AI into the development lifecycle. We provide two complementary approaches: a comprehensive workflow for enterprise projects and a lightweight workflow for rapid prototyping and smaller projects.

By following these workflows, teams can efficiently integrate AI into their development processes, ensuring high-quality results, maintainable code, and streamlined operations. Both workflows emphasize iteration, validation, and continuous learning to maximize AI's potential in the SDLC.

## Workflow Options

### Comprehensive Workflow
For enterprise projects, complex systems, and team-based development requiring thorough documentation and process adherence.

### Lightweight Workflow  
For rapid prototyping, small projects, and situations where speed and flexibility are prioritized over comprehensive documentation.

## Comprehensive Workflow Steps

1. **[Getting Started](01-getting-started.md)** - A conceptual overview of getting started with AI development workflows.
2. **[Project Setup](02-project-setup.md)** - Define the foundational elements for the project, ensuring all necessary files, tools, and conventions are in place.
3. **Feature Development Lifecycle**

    1. [Functional Requirements](03-functional-requirement.md) - Define expected behavior, UI, testable features, and user experience using AI tools to draft and refine.
    2. [Technical Specification](04-technical-specification.md) - Define technical implementation, data models, API endpoints, and backend architecture.
    3. [Development](05-development.md) - Develop the solution iteratively, leveraging AI for implementation.
    4. [Testing](06-testing.md) - Unit, Functional and End to End testing
    5. [Refactoring](07-refactoring.md) - Refactor once feature complete.
    6. [Documentation](08-documentation.md) - Update all relevant documentation to reflect changes, ensuring clarity and alignment with project goals.  Documentation is then used to feedback to the AI tools for future iterations.

4. **[Lightweight Workflow](09-lightweight-workflow.md)** - A streamlined approach for rapid prototyping and smaller projects, emphasizing speed and minimal overhead.
5. [Learning with AI](99-learning.md)
