Step-by-step walkthrough of the three-phase spec-driven development workflow.

## In This Section

- **[Requirements Phase](01-requirements-phase.md)** - Gathering and structuring requirements using EARS format
- **[Design Phase](02-design-phase.md)** - Creating comprehensive design documents with research
- **[Tasks Phase](03-tasks-phase.md)** - Breaking down design into actionable coding tasks
- **[Change Management](04-change-management.md)** - Managing spec evolution and handling discovered requirements

## The Three-Phase Workflow

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
  [*] --> Requirements : Start with user needs
  Requirements --> Design : Requirements approved
  Design --> Tasks : Design approved
  Tasks --> [*] : Ready for implementation
  
  Requirements --> Requirements : Iterate based on feedback
  Design --> Design : Refine design
  Tasks --> Tasks : Adjust task breakdown
```

Each phase builds upon the previous one, with explicit approval gates to ensure quality and alignment before proceeding.

### Phase 1: [Requirements Gathering](01-requirements-phase.md)

**Purpose**: Transform vague feature ideas into clear, testable requirements

**Key Activities**:

- Capture user stories that express value and purpose
- Define acceptance criteria using EARS (Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax)
- Identify edge cases and constraints
- Validate completeness and feasibility

**Benefits**:

- Ensures all stakeholders understand what's being built
- Provides clear success criteria for implementation
- Reduces scope creep and feature drift
- Creates a foundation for testing and validation

### Phase 2: [Technical Design](02-design-phase.md)

**Purpose**: Create a comprehensive technical plan for implementation

**Key Activities**:

- Research technical approaches and constraints
- Define system architecture and component interactions
- Specify data models and interfaces
- Plan error handling and testing strategies

**Benefits**:

- Identifies technical challenges before coding begins
- Enables better estimation and resource planning
- Provides a roadmap for implementation
- Documents design decisions and their rationale

### Phase 3: [Task Planning](03-tasks-phase.md)

**Purpose**: Break down the design into actionable, sequential implementation steps

**Key Activities**:

- Convert design elements into specific coding tasks
- Sequence tasks to enable incremental progress
- Define clear objectives and completion criteria
- Reference requirements to ensure traceability

**Benefits**:

- Makes large features manageable through decomposition
- Enables parallel work and better progress tracking
- Reduces cognitive load during implementation
- Facilitates code review and quality assurance
