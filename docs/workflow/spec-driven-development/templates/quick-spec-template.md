**Status:** Approved

## Overview

**What:** Allow users to upload and display profile pictures in their account settings  
**Why:** Users want to personalize their profiles and be more recognizable to teammates  
**Success Metric:** 50% of active users upload a profile picture within 30 days

## Requirements

### User Story
**As a** registered user  
**I want** to upload a profile picture  
**So that** my profile is more personalized and I'm recognizable to teammates

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] User can click "Upload Photo" button in profile settings
- [ ] System accepts JPG, PNG, and GIF files up to 5MB
- [ ] Image is automatically resized to 200x200px
- [ ] Profile picture displays in navigation bar and profile page
- [ ] User can remove their profile picture and return to default avatar
- [ ] Error messages show for invalid file types or sizes

### Constraints
- **Technical:** Must integrate with existing S3 bucket for file storage
- **Business:** Images must be family-friendly (manual moderation for now)
- **Timeline:** Needed for Q1 user engagement goals

## Implementation Plan

### Prerequisites
- [ ] Confirm S3 bucket permissions for profile-images folder
- [ ] Install image processing library (sharp.js)

### Core Tasks
1. **Frontend Upload Component** - Add file upload UI to profile settings
   - **Estimate:** 6 hours
   - **Details:** File input, preview, progress indicator, error handling

2. **Backend Upload Endpoint** - Handle file upload and processing
   - **Estimate:** 8 hours
   - **Details:** Validate file, resize image, upload to S3, update user record

3. **Profile Display Updates** - Show profile pictures throughout app
   - **Estimate:** 4 hours
   - **Details:** Update navbar component, profile page, user cards

### Testing Tasks
- [ ] **Unit Tests:** File validation, image processing functions
- [ ] **Integration Tests:** Upload endpoint, S3 integration
- [ ] **Manual Testing:** Upload flow, different file types, error cases

### Documentation Tasks
- [ ] **Code Comments:** Image processing and S3 upload functions
- [ ] **API Docs:** Document new upload endpoint

## Technical Notes

### Files to Modify
- `components/ProfileSettings.jsx` - Add upload UI
