## Integration Patterns and Best Practices

### API Integration Patterns

#### Webhook-Based Integration
```javascript
// Example: GitHub webhook to update project management tool
app.post('/webhook/github', (req, res) => {
  const { action, pull_request } = req.body;
  
  if (action === 'opened' && pull_request.title.includes('[REQ-')) {
    // Extract requirement ID from PR title
    const reqId = pull_request.title.match(/\[REQ-(\d+\.\d+)\]/)[1];
    
    // Update project management tool
    await updateTaskStatus(reqId, 'in_progress');
  }
  
  res.status(200).send('OK');
});
```

#### Polling-Based Integration
```javascript
// Example: Sync requirement status between tools
async function syncRequirementStatus() {
  const requirements = await getRequirementsFromSource();
  
  for (const req of requirements) {
    const currentStatus = await getStatusFromProjectTool(req.id);
    const expectedStatus = await getStatusFromRequirementTool(req.id);
    
    if (currentStatus !== expectedStatus) {
      await updateStatus(req.id, expectedStatus);
    }
  }
}

// Run every 15 minutes
setInterval(syncRequirementStatus, 15 * 60 * 1000);
```

#### Event-Driven Integration
```javascript
// Example: Event bus for tool integration
class SpecEventBus {
  constructor() {
    this.subscribers = new Map();
  }
  
  subscribe(event, handler) {
    if (!this.subscribers.has(event)) {
      this.subscribers.set(event, []);
    }
    this.subscribers.get(event).push(handler);
  }
  
  publish(event, data) {
    const handlers = this.subscribers.get(event) || [];
    handlers.forEach(handler => handler(data));
  }
}

// Usage
const eventBus = new SpecEventBus();

eventBus.subscribe('requirement.updated', async (data) => {
  await updateProjectManagementTool(data);
  await notifyStakeholders(data);
  await updateDocumentation(data);
});
```

### Data Synchronization Strategies

#### Master-Slave Pattern
- One tool serves as the master source of truth
- Other tools sync from the master
- Simple to implement and maintain
- Risk of data loss if master fails

#### Multi-Master Pattern
- Multiple tools can update the same data
- Conflict resolution mechanisms required
- More complex but more resilient
- Better for distributed teams

#### Event Sourcing Pattern
- All changes are stored as events
- Tools replay events to build current state
- Excellent audit trail and debugging
- More complex to implement

### Automation Workflows

#### Requirement Lifecycle Automation
```yaml
# GitHub Actions workflow for requirement updates
name: Requirement Lifecycle
on:
  push:
    paths:
      - '.kiro/specs/*/requirements.md'

jobs:
  validate-requirements:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Validate EARS format
        run: |
          python scripts/validate_ears.py
      - name: Update project management
        run: |
          python scripts/sync_requirements.py
      - name: Notify stakeholders
        run: |
          python scripts/notify_stakeholders.py
```

#### Testing Integration Automation
```yaml
# Automated testing based on requirements
name: Requirement Testing
on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize]

jobs:
  test-requirements:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Extract requirement IDs
        id: extract
        run: |
          echo "::set-output name=req_ids::$(grep -o 'REQ-[0-9]\+\.[0-9]\+' ${{ github.event.pull_request.body }})"
      - name: Run requirement-specific tests
        run: |
          npm test -- --grep "${{ steps.extract.outputs.req_ids }}"
```
