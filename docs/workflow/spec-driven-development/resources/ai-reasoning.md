## Overview

This document provides insights into the decision-making frameworks and thought processes used by AI during spec-driven development. Understanding these frameworks helps developers collaborate more effectively with AI systems and anticipate how decisions will be made throughout the requirements, design, and task phases.

## Understanding AI Decision-Making

AI systems approach spec development through systematic frameworks that include:

- **Requirement Analysis** - How user needs are interpreted and structured
- **Design Evaluation** - Criteria used to assess technical approaches
- **Task Sequencing** - Logic behind implementation order and dependencies
- **Trade-off Assessment** - How competing priorities are balanced

## Why This Matters

Understanding the reasoning process helps you:

- Provide better input and feedback during spec development
- Anticipate potential issues or alternative approaches
- Learn systematic thinking patterns for your own planning
- Collaborate more effectively with AI systems

## Requirements Analysis Framework

### Prioritization Criteria

When analyzing and prioritizing requirements, the AI applies these evaluation criteria in order:

- **User Impact Severity**
   - Critical: Core functionality that blocks primary user workflows
   - High: Important features that significantly affect user experience
   - Medium: Useful features that enhance but don't block workflows
   - Low: Nice-to-have features that provide marginal value
- **Technical Feasibility**
   - Immediate: Can be implemented with existing tools and patterns
   - Moderate: Requires research or learning new approaches
   - Complex: Needs significant architectural decisions or new infrastructure
   - Uncertain: Requires proof-of-concept or technical validation
- **Dependency Relationships**
   - Foundation: Must be implemented before other features can work
   - Independent: Can be implemented in any order
   - Dependent: Requires other features to be completed first
   - Optional: Enhances other features but isn't required

### Requirements Validation Process

The AI follows this systematic approach to validate requirements:

```
Input: Raw requirement statement
↓
1. Clarity Check
   - Is the requirement unambiguous?
   - Are all terms clearly defined?
   - Can success be objectively measured?
↓
2. Completeness Analysis
   - Are all necessary conditions specified?
   - Are edge cases considered?
   - Are error scenarios addressed?
↓
3. Consistency Verification
   - Does this conflict with other requirements?
   - Are there logical contradictions?
   - Do related requirements align?
↓
4. Feasibility Assessment
   - Is this technically achievable?
   - Are there resource constraints?
   - What are the implementation risks?
↓
Output: Validated requirement with confidence level
```

## Design Decision Framework

### Architecture Decision Criteria

When making architectural decisions, the AI evaluates options using these weighted factors:

1. **Maintainability (30%)**
   1. Code clarity and readability
   2. Separation of concerns
   3. Testing ease and coverage potential
   4. Documentation requirements
2. **Scalability (25%)**
   1. Performance under load
   2. Resource utilization efficiency
   3. Horizontal scaling potential
   4. Future extension capabilities
3. **Reliability (20%)**
   1. Error handling robustness
   2. Failure recovery mechanisms
   3. Data consistency guarantees
   4. Monitoring and observability
4. **Development Velocity (15%)**
   1. Implementation complexity
   2. Time to first working version
   3. Learning curve for team
   4. Available tooling and libraries
5. **Security (10%)**
   1. Attack surface minimization
   2. Data protection mechanisms
   3. Access control implementation
   4. Compliance requirements

### Technology Selection Process

The AI uses this decision tree for technology choices:

```
Technology Decision Required
↓
1. Requirement Analysis
   - What specific problem needs solving?
   - What are the performance requirements?
   - What are the integration constraints?
↓
2. Option Generation
   - List 3-5 viable alternatives
   - Include both familiar and emerging options
   - Consider build vs. buy decisions
↓
3. Evaluation Matrix
   - Score each option against criteria (1-5 scale)
   - Weight scores by importance
   - Calculate total weighted scores
↓
4. Risk Assessment
   - Identify implementation risks for top options
   - Evaluate mitigation strategies
   - Consider fallback alternatives
↓
5. Decision Documentation
   - Record chosen option with rationale
   - Document rejected alternatives and reasons
   - Note assumptions and dependencies
```

## Task Breakdown Framework

### Complexity Assessment

The AI evaluates task complexity using these dimensions:

- **Technical Complexity**
   - Simple: Uses well-known patterns and libraries
   - Moderate: Requires integration of multiple components
   - Complex: Needs custom algorithms or novel approaches
   - Expert: Requires deep domain knowledge or research
- **Scope Breadth**
   - Focused: Single component or function
   - Moderate: Multiple related components
   - Broad: Cross-cutting concerns or system-wide changes
   - Extensive: Major architectural modifications
- **Dependency Depth**
   - Independent: No dependencies on other tasks
   - Shallow: 1-2 direct dependencies
   - Moderate: 3-5 dependencies with some chains
   - Deep: Complex dependency networks

### Task Sequencing Logic

The AI applies these rules for task ordering:

1. **Foundation First**: Infrastructure and core interfaces before implementations
2. **Bottom-Up Dependencies**: Complete prerequisites before dependent tasks
3. **Risk Mitigation**: Address high-risk items early for faster feedback
4. **Incremental Value**: Prioritize tasks that enable early testing and validation
5. **Parallel Opportunities**: Identify tasks that can be worked on simultaneously

## Decision Point Examples

### Example 1: Database Choice for User Management

**Context**: Need to store user profiles and authentication data

**Options Considered**:
- PostgreSQL (relational)
- MongoDB (document)
- Redis (key-value)

**Evaluation**:
```
Criteria          | PostgreSQL | MongoDB | Redis
------------------|------------|---------|-------
ACID Compliance   |     5      |    3    |   2
Query Flexibility |     5      |    4    |   2
Performance       |     4      |    4    |   5
Team Familiarity  |     5      |    3    |   3
Operational Cost  |     4      |    3    |   4
Weighted Score    |   4.6      |   3.4   |  3.2
```

**Decision**: PostgreSQL chosen for ACID compliance and team familiarity
**Rationale**: User data integrity is critical, and team expertise reduces implementation risk

### Example 2: API Design Pattern

**Context**: Need to expose user management functionality via REST API

**Options Considered**:
- RESTful resources
- RPC-style endpoints
- GraphQL

**Decision Process**:

1. **Requirements Analysis**: CRUD operations, simple queries, mobile client
2. **Complexity Assessment**: RESTful = Simple, RPC = Simple, GraphQL = Moderate
3. **Client Needs**: Mobile app needs predictable, cacheable responses
4. **Team Capability**: Strong REST experience, limited GraphQL knowledge

**Decision**: RESTful resources
**Rationale**: Matches team skills, meets client needs, lowest implementation risk

**Context**: [What situation requires a decision?]

**Options**: [What alternatives were considered?]

**Criteria**: [What factors influenced the decision?]
