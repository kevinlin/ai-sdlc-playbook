# MCP Server for Cursor

## What is an MCP Server?

The MCP (Model Control Protocol) server is a backend service designed to extend the capabilities of the Cursor editor and similar code tools. It acts as a bridge between the editor and advanced code intelligence, automation, and integration features. MCP servers can provide

- Integration with external APIs and tools
- Custom commands and workflows

## Usage

1. Browse the rules for the relevant language and framework
2. Apply the applicable rules to your project
3. Contribute your own rules back

## Role in Coding and Cursor
