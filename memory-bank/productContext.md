# Product Context: AI SDLC Playbook

## Problem Statement
Development teams are increasingly adopting AI tools like Cursor, GitHub Copilot, and other AI-powered assistants, but lack structured guidance on how to integrate these tools effectively into their development workflows. Without proper guidelines, teams may:
- Use AI tools inefficiently or inconsistently
- Struggle to maintain code quality standards with AI assistance
- Miss opportunities to leverage AI for productivity gains
- Lack standardized prompts and practices for common development tasks

## User Experience Goals
- **Accessibility**: Documentation should be easy to navigate and search
- **Practicality**: Provide actionable guidance that can be immediately implemented
- **Comprehensiveness**: Cover the full development lifecycle from setup to deployment
- **Consistency**: Maintain uniform formatting and structure across all documentation
- **Discoverability**: Enable users to quickly find relevant information for their specific needs
- **Maintainability**: Allow for easy updates and contributions from the community

## Success Metrics
- **Adoption**: Number of teams implementing the documented practices
- **Contribution**: Community contributions and feedback on the documentation
- **Usage**: Website traffic and engagement metrics on the published documentation
- **Effectiveness**: Reported improvements in development productivity and code quality
- **Completeness**: Coverage of all major AI development workflow scenarios
- **Relevance**: Regular updates reflecting current AI development practices
