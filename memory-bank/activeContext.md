# Active Context: AI SDLC Playbook

## Current Work Focus
Memory Bank initialization - Setting up the foundational documentation structure that will enable effective AI assistance across the project lifecycle. This includes establishing the core memory bank files that will serve as the primary reference for understanding project context, progress, and technical decisions.

## Recent Changes
- Created memory-bank directory structure
- Initialized core memory bank files (memory_bank_instructions.md, projectbrief.md, productContext.md)
- Established project documentation framework
- Set up MkDocs-based documentation generation system
- Configured GitHub Pages deployment workflow

## Next Steps
- Complete remaining memory bank files (systemPatterns.md, techContext.md, progress.md)
- Review and validate all memory bank content for accuracy
- Ensure memory bank files are properly integrated with the existing documentation structure
- Test memory bank effectiveness for project context understanding
- Document any project-specific patterns or preferences discovered during initialization

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- **Documentation Structure**: Maintaining consistency with existing MkDocs structure while adding memory bank capabilities
- **Content Depth**: Balancing comprehensive documentation with maintainability
- **Integration Approach**: Ensuring memory bank complements rather than duplicates existing documentation
- **Update Frequency**: Establishing patterns for when and how memory bank files should be updated

## Important Patterns and Preferences
- **Markdown Formatting**: Following established markdown guidelines with ATX headings and consistent list formatting
- **File Organization**: Maintaining clear separation between memory bank files and main documentation
- **Content Structure**: Using hierarchical organization from general (projectbrief) to specific (activeContext, progress)
- **Documentation Standards**: Adhering to existing style guides and formatting conventions

## Learnings and Project Insights
- Project has well-established documentation patterns and structure
- Strong focus on practical, actionable guidance for AI development workflows
- Community-oriented approach with emphasis on contributions and feedback
- Clear separation between different types of documentation (rules, workflows, prompts)
- Emphasis on maintaining high-quality, accessible documentation for diverse audiences
