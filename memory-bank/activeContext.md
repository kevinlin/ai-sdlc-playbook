# Active Context: AI SDLC Playbook

## Current Work Focus
Lightweight workflow integration - Added a new lightweight development workflow for rapid prototyping and smaller projects. This provides an alternative to the comprehensive workflow, emphasizing speed and minimal overhead while maintaining quality standards.

## Recent Changes
- Added new lightweight development workflow document (09-lightweight-workflow.md)
- Updated workflow README to distinguish between comprehensive and lightweight approaches
- Updated main docs README to include lightweight workflow in table of contents
- Adapted Harper Reed's LLM codegen workflow methodology to fit project structure and tone
- Integrated lightweight workflow as complementary approach to existing comprehensive workflow

## Next Steps
- Gather feedback on the lightweight workflow from development teams
- Create example projects demonstrating the lightweight workflow in action
- Consider adding tool-specific guides for different AI coding assistants
- Develop templates for common project types (web apps, APIs, CLI tools)
- Document best practices for transitioning from lightweight to comprehensive workflow

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- **Documentation Structure**: Maintaining consistency with existing MkDocs structure while adding memory bank capabilities
- **Content Depth**: Balancing comprehensive documentation with maintainability
- **Integration Approach**: Ensuring memory bank complements rather than duplicates existing documentation
- **Update Frequency**: Establishing patterns for when and how memory bank files should be updated

## Important Patterns and Preferences
- **Markdown Formatting**: Following established markdown guidelines with ATX headings and consistent list formatting
- **File Organization**: Maintaining clear separation between memory bank files and main documentation
- **Content Structure**: Using hierarchical organization from general (projectbrief) to specific (activeContext, progress)
- **Documentation Standards**: Adhering to existing style guides and formatting conventions

## Learnings and Project Insights
- Project has well-established documentation patterns and structure
- Strong focus on practical, actionable guidance for AI development workflows
- Community-oriented approach with emphasis on contributions and feedback
- Clear separation between different types of documentation (rules, workflows, prompts)
- Emphasis on maintaining high-quality, accessible documentation for diverse audiences
