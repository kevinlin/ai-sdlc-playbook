# Active Context: AI SDLC Playbook

## Current Work Focus
Memory Bank system integration - Completing the integration of Memory Bank MCP server tools into the project setup workflow. This includes refining the initialization process and ensuring proper documentation of the Memory Bank setup steps for development teams.

## Recent Changes
- Updated project setup documentation to include Memory Bank initialization
- Added specific instructions for Memory Bank MCP server installation
- Refined Memory Bank initialization process with standardized prompt: "Initialize memory bank with tools"
- Completed core memory bank files structure and content
- Integrated Memory Bank setup into the standard project workflow documentation

## Next Steps
- Validate Memory Bank MCP server integration instructions
- Test the standardized initialization prompt with development teams
- Gather feedback on Memory Bank effectiveness for project context understanding
- Consider adding more detailed MCP server configuration guidance
- Document best practices for Memory Bank maintenance and updates

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- **Documentation Structure**: Maintaining consistency with existing MkDocs structure while adding memory bank capabilities
- **Content Depth**: Balancing comprehensive documentation with maintainability
- **Integration Approach**: Ensuring memory bank complements rather than duplicates existing documentation
- **Update Frequency**: Establishing patterns for when and how memory bank files should be updated

## Important Patterns and Preferences
- **Markdown Formatting**: Following established markdown guidelines with ATX headings and consistent list formatting
- **File Organization**: Maintaining clear separation between memory bank files and main documentation
- **Content Structure**: Using hierarchical organization from general (projectbrief) to specific (activeContext, progress)
- **Documentation Standards**: Adhering to existing style guides and formatting conventions

## Learnings and Project Insights
- Project has well-established documentation patterns and structure
- Strong focus on practical, actionable guidance for AI development workflows
- Community-oriented approach with emphasis on contributions and feedback
- Clear separation between different types of documentation (rules, workflows, prompts)
- Emphasis on maintaining high-quality, accessible documentation for diverse audiences
