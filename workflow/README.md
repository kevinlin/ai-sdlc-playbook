# AI Development Workflow

This section outlines a streamlined workflow for integrating AI into the development lifecycle. The workflow ensures a consistent approach to developing, testing, and refining AI-driven solutions.

By following this workflow, teams can efficiently integrate AI into their development processes, ensuring high-quality results, maintainable code, and streamlined operations. The workflow emphasizes iteration, validation, and continuous learning to maximize AI's potential in the SDLC.

## Workflow Steps

1. **[Getting Started](workflow-getting-started.md)** - A conceptual overview of getting started with AI development workflows.
2. **[Project Setup](workflow-project-setup.md)** - Define the foundational elements for the project, ensuring all necessary files, tools, and conventions are in place.
3. **Feature Development Lifecycle**
	1. [Product Requirements](workflow-product-requirements.md) - Establish clear and concise requirements for the feature using AI tools to draft and refine.
	2. [Development](workflow-development.md) - Develop the solution iteratively, leveraging AI for implementation.
	3. [Testing](workflow-testing.md) - Unit, Functional and End to End testing
	4. [Refactoring](workflow-refactoring.md) - Refactor once feature complete.
	5. [Documentation](workflow-documentation.md) - Update all relevant documentation to reflect changes, ensuring clarity and alignment with project goals.  Documentation is then used to feedback to the AI tools for future iterations.
