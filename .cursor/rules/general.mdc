# General Rules
- Think step by step and plan before making any additions or changes to the code.
- Always make targeted edits when changing.
- Make sure you do not remove any text or code that is needed, validate you have made a targeted edit.
- Always summarise your changes to validate after making changes.

# Refactoring Rules
When reviewing and refactoring content:
- Only make targeted improvements if it helps with the readability.
- We do not want to lose content, so don't remove anything that would diminish the original ideas conveyed in the text.
- Don't overly generalise things, make the content specific.
- Keep the changes to content improvements. Do not change the structure.
