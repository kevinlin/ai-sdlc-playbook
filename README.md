## ðŸ”§ Development & Site Publishing

### Setting up Python Virtual Environment

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Local Development

Start a local development server:

```bash
mkdocs serve --dev-addr=0.0.0.0:8000
```

### Building the Site

Build the static site:

```bash
mkdocs build
```

### GitHub Actions Deployment

This repository includes a GitHub Actions workflow that automatically builds and deploys the site to GitHub Pages when:

- Changes are pushed to the main branch
- The workflow is manually triggered from the Actions tab

The workflow configuration is located in `.github/workflows/publish.yml` and uses GitHub's official Pages deployment actions with the following steps:

1. Checkout the source code
2. Set up Python environment
3. Install dependencies and build the site
4. Upload the generated files as an artifact
5. Deploy to GitHub Pages

To manually trigger a deployment, go to the Actions tab in the GitHub repository and run the "Build & Publish site to GitHub Pages" workflow.
